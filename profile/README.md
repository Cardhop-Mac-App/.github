## What is Cardhop for Mac?

Cardhop for Mac is a revolutionary contact management application developed by Flexibits. It allows users to interact with their address book using natural language commands, making it faster and more intuitive to add, edit, find, and communicate with contacts.

The app supports deep integration with macOS native services and popular platforms like iCloud, Google Contacts, Exchange, and more. With powerful parsing and automation features, Cardhop understands input like "John Doe company Apple phone 555-1234" and creates or updates contact entries accordingly.

Its clean, minimalist interface is designed for efficiency. Whether you're a sales professional managing hundreds of leads or an individual organizing personal connections, Cardhop simplifies the process. The application also includes features like groups, favorites, birthdays, and activity history to keep your network well-maintained.

Fully optimized for macOS Sonoma, Ventura, and older versions, Cardhop runs smoothly on MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and desktop Macs with Intel or Apple Silicon chips. It respects privacy and stores data securely while providing seamless synchronization across devices.
